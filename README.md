# landing-page-odin
This is a landing page I created from learning from the Odin Project resources. This implements html, css, and flex for alignment.

Applied Skills:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - FlexBox

What I learned:
For creating my first landing page using CSS, I have defintely had to go back a few times to remember some concepts. Besides that,
this was a great practice to see how much I have learned so far using these concepts. From only knowing backend concepts from classes,
the creation of the landing page was a great leap foward to front-end development. 

Needs to be Improved on:
The biggest difficulties I had was defintely spacing with flex box and image manipulation. What helped the most was showing solid
borders then removing it. What could be improved on for this landing page is adding my own creative aspects and fix some spacing issues.
I believe this is a great start to a project that can be improved on the more I learn.
